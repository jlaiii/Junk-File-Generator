# Junk File Generator
A Powershell script for generating junk files to test drive capacity.

## Usage
To use the script, simply run it in Powershell and it will begin creating junk files in a folder called "junk" in the same directory as the script. The script will continue running until the drive becomes full, at which point it will output a message and terminate.
